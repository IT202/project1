# Project 1 - Simple "About Me" Page

With this project, you'll demonstrate that you understand some HTML and CSS basics, and that you understand how to work with GitHub and Cloud9.  

You'll create a simple "About Me" page that includes multiple elements with some basic CSS.

The page should include your name as an H1 element; one or more pictures sized, with a border and padding; and some "top 3" "ordered list" of your favorites (e.g., movies, food.)   Each list item should include a relevant link for that item (to a website, an image, etc.), and that link should open in a new tab/window.

Use a tag/element selector to style the list items, use a class selector to style the picture(s), and use a id selector to style the h1 element.

The file should be named `index.html`, in a folder named `project1`.   Folder and file names are case-sensitive.
